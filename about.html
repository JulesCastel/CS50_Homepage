                &emsp;My name is Jules, I'm based out of Dallas, Texas and I love...
              </p>
              <h5>💻Coding!🖥</h5>
              <p>
                &emsp;I have been coding in one form or another since I was 15 and it seems like I just can't get away from it LOL, see my <a href="coding.html">coding page</a> for more information.
              </p>
              <h5>🎼Music!🎙</h5>
              <p>
                &emsp;I have been seriously playing music since I was 12 and I play a few instruments including (but not limited to): piano, guitar, bass, drums, vocals, synthesizer, ukulele, violin, marimba (and the other mallet keyboard instruments), and a bunch of random percussion instruments. See my <a href="music.html">music page</a> for some of the stuff I'm involved in.
              </p>
              <h5>🗣Languages!🌐</h5>
              <p>
                &emsp;I had a huge multi-year linguistics phase that completely swallowed me, to the point that led me to pursue a Linguistics degree at The University of Texas at Austin <font size="1">(hook em)</font>. I studied French and Japanese in high school, and then Mandarin and MSA & Levantine in college. At home, I've studied to some extent (however small) Esperanto, Turkish, and Swedish. I also dabbled with colanging, which is the art of creating your own language, but I didn't get anywhere near as far into it as others.
              </p>
              <h5>🎮Video games!👾</h5>
              <p>
                &emsp;While I'm nowhere near the gamer I used to be, I legit learned how to read from playing Pokémon Yellow for the Game Boy Color (shoutout to my cousin Angel for giving me his copy). Growing up poor meant that I pirated A LOT of video games and the troubleshooting/fixes I had to do to get these dodgy downloads to work led to the computer skills I have now.

              <h5>🌳Nature🌿</h5>
              <p>
                &emsp;I <em>live</em> for the natural beauty of the world and while I'm stuck living in a suburban concrete jungle, there's nothing quite as enjoyable than taking a quiet walk through a nice forested path. I have a few national parks such as Big Bend on my bucket list that I would like to visit at some point, but all in good time. I also plan on getting a mountain bike so I can take it on trails but they're <em>so</em> expensive!!
              </p>
              <h5>🛫Airplanes!🛬</h5>
              <p>
                &emsp;When I was a kid, my biggest wish was to be able to fly, so it's only natural that I became intersted in aviation. I've spent WAY too many hours on flight simulators growing up and I'm the go-to pilot for my online friend group whenever we play games like Arma 3 or GTA V. When flying, my favorite seat is the window seat by either wing. I hope to be able to get my pilot license at some point in my life and if I'm ever rich enough, to buy my own cute little Cessna.

              <h5>In short</h5>
              <p>
                &emsp;As you can see I have a lot of interests!! I have a never-ending curiousity for the world and I think it's important to be interested in everything the human experience has to offer.
